# Geyser3
When relooking at Geyser as an entirety, we thought, this can be simpler. Java and Bedrock crossplay is cool and all, but more than one class file? Ridiculous.

With a sleek, innovative design, Geyser3 is done and ready to ship out to the public. We have completely removed all crossplay features and have instead
added one singular command.

# New Purpose
Geyser3 allows users to *become* the Geyser. This technology has never been available to the public up until now. 

# PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION, THERE IS A VERY HIGH CHANCE YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO PUT GEYSER3 DOWN UPON USING.

NOW SUPPORTS MINECRAFT: TOASTER EDITION
